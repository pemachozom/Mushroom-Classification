# 🍄 Mushroom Classification – Machine Learning Project

This project was developed as part of **CSC210 – MINI PROJECT II** at Gyalpozhing College of Information Technology (GCIT). It is a **semester-long project** completed by a team of **five members**, including myself.

## 📌 Project Overview

The Mushroom Classification project aims to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify mushrooms as **edible** or **poisonous** based on various physical characteristics such as cap shape, gill color, odor, and habitat.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Clean and preprocess the mushroom dataset
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Train and evaluate multiple classification models
- Compare model performance and select the best one
- Interpret model results and make data-driven conclusions

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 👥 Team Members

- Pema Chozom  
- Deki Lhazom
- Sonam Choden 
- Dal Bdr Rai 
- Tenzin Namgyal Yeshi

---

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

- Data preprocessing and feature encoding
- Model selection (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression)
- Accuracy and performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Collaborative teamwork using GitLab

---

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used is the [UCI Mushroom Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/mushroom-classification), containing 8,124 instances with 22 attributes.
In addition to this, we also **manually collected mushroom data available in Bhutan** to enhance the relevance and diversity of our model. These local samples helped us analyze species that are commonly found in the Bhutanese environment and added a regional perspective to the classification task.
